## Coding standards
When contributing, please follow the coding standards so we have nice looking code that's easy to follow for everyone.

#### Editorconfig
Use an editor (or a plugin for your editor) that supports [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/).

The editorconfig file should set your editor to the following settings automatically:
- UTF-8 charset
- Unix-style line breaks
- End file with a new line
- No trailing whitespace before a line break
- Use tabs for indentation

Tab width is not defined in the editorconfig, so each deveveloper can set their editor's tab width to what they're most comfortable with.

Make sure your editor settings don't conflict with the editorconfig settings. Most plugins will have some way of telling you if this happens.

#### Furthermore:
- Always add comments to your code where necessary. The project should be accessible for devs of all experience and skill levels. Better to have too many comments, than none at all.
- Whitespace is not the enemy! A couple of empty lines between blocks of code can really improve readability of your code.

#### For Javascript specifically:
- Always use semicolons
- Declare your variables first, in the scope where they're used
- Use `let` and `const` where applicable
