## Coding standards
When contributing, please try to follow the coding standards so we have nice looking code that's easy to follow for everyone.

#### Editorconfig
Where possible, use an editor (or a plugin for your editor) that supports [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/).

The editorconfig file should set your editor to the following settings automatically:
- UTF-8 charset
- Unix-style line breaks
- End file with a new line
- No trailing whitespace before a line break
- Use tabs for indentation

Tab width is not defined in the editorconfig, so each deveveloper can set their editor's tab width to what they're most comfortable with.

#### Furthermore:
- Add comments to your code where necessary. The project should be accessible for devs of all experience and skill levels. Better to have too many comments, than none at all.
- Whitespace is not the enemy! A couple of empty lines between blocks of code can really improve readability.

#### For Javascript specifically:
- Use semicolons (even through they're not strictly necessary). It's good practice!
- Use `let` and `const` where applicable, to keep the scope of your variables specific. Don't know what scope is or what `let` does? Check out [this article](https://medium.com/@MentallyFriendly/es6-an-idiots-guide-to-let-and-const-70be9691c389).
- Use `lowerCamelCase` for variable names (not `snake_case`)
